Subject: Lighting

This package includes a Python script for Unreal Engine that scans all level actors and replaces 
Datasmith-imported Revit ceiling lights (identified by the tag "Max_superclassId: light") 
with the Blueprint instance "BP_CeilingLight_01".

Instructions:
1. Open your project in Unreal Engine.
2. Open the Output Log or Python Editor.
3. Run the contents of replace_revit_lights.py.
4. All tagged Revit light meshes will be replaced in-place with your custom Blueprint.
